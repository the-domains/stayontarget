Inspiration comes and goes. It's the natural ebb and flow of life. But what if we could swing more to the side of being inspired a majority of time?

When you're inspired, are you more creative?

When you're inspired, are you more willing to learn?

When you're inspired, are you more likely to achieve greatness?

I don't know about you, but I answer a big YES to those questions.

So, in my first video ever, I share my simple tips on the topic of finding inspiration.

2 warnings before clicking the link to watch the video...

1\. I recorded this video with a lot of energy. So, depending on what time of day you view this video you may love or hate me. I'm looking at you, my 6am email openers. The one who views this before they start their day. Watch this video 

you've had your first cup of coffee

2\. This was recorded in one take. It's not polished. It's not perfect. The goal with this is one quick message straight from the heart. That's it. Nothing flashy and nothing for sale here. Haha.
